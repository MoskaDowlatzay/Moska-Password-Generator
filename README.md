# Moska-Password-Generator

 This challenge requires me to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they’ve selected by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. 

Sorry this homework has been left incomplete and rushed, i didnt have the time this week to complete the homework but I wanted to submit it.
